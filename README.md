[00:09.73] Life is good in a small fairytale
[00:14.22] My hands are warm, my cheeks are swirled in rosy red
[00:20.83] Lips burst on your head
[00:24.71] 'Cause you're the line that pulls me from the void
[00:29.64] You're the break in all the noise rocking in my head
[00:36.18] Oh, rock me to bed
[00:45.18] 
[00:41.60] So what's the use in being here?
[00:44.98] We could be up there instead
[00:58.98] 
[00:51.58] I'd light fires in the sky
[00:56.55] I'm folding chairs right on the moon with you, with you
[01:06.34] I watch the world float by
[01:11.49] I'm folding chairs right on the moon with you, with you
[01:38.99] 
[01:28.74] Once upon a time, I held your hand, and you held mine
[01:34.71] And for a second, I forgot everything that was
[01:43.59] And everything that might become of us
[01:48.55] Would this place just turn to dust when we are gone
[01:54.32] From this third rock from the sun?
[02:11.32] 
[02:00.52] As long as we have got each other
[02:04.24] We can do no wrong
[02:13.24] 
[02:08.08] I'd light fires in the sky
[02:13.04] I'm folding chairs right on the moon with you, with you
[02:22.98] I watch the world float by
[02:28.04] I'm folding chairs right on the moon with you, with you
[02:55.54] 
[02:52.64] On the moon with you, with you
[03:00.19] On the moon with you, with you
