Life is good in
a small fairytale
My hands are warm,
my cheeks are swirled in
rosy red
Lips burst on your head
'Cause your the line that
pulls me from the void
You're the break in the
noise rocking in my head
Oh, rock me to bed
So what's the use in being here
We could be up there instead
I'd light fires in the sky
I'm folding chairs right on
the moon with you, with you
I watch the world float by
I'm folding chairs right on
the moon with you, with you
Once upon a time I held
your hand
And you held mine for
a second I forgot
Everything that was
And everythin' that might
become of us
Would this place just turn
to dust when we are gone
From this third rock from
the sun
As long as we got each other
We could do no wrong
I'd light fires in the sky
I'm folding chairs right on
the moon with you, with you
I watch the world float by
I'm folding chairs right on
the moon with you, with you
On the moon with you, with you
On the moon with you, with you
